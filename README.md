# Overview

This analytical approach was developed to identify bursts of rapid HIV transmission across a clock-tree and characterize the contribution of bursts of rapid transmission to future transmission. The application of this approach is described in detail in a manuscript titled 'Contribution of HIV transmission bursts to future HIV infections, United States' (DOI: 10.1097/QAD.0000000000004101).

## Outline

The script infers a maximum likelihood phylogeny using FastTree2 and optimizes time-scaled phylogenies and infers transmission dates corresponding to dated internal nodes within each phylogeny using TreeTime. HIV transmission bursts are identified as three or more internal nodes descended from a single lineage within a defined detection period and are detected using tree-traversal implemented in ETE3. Lineages during the burst detection period are classified as burst-involved or non-burst-involved, where a lineage is considered involved in a transmission burst if it is the product of an inferred transmission event within a burst. Inferred transmission events, or internal nodes, dated during a defined follow-up period are identified as descended from lineages involved or not involved in transmission bursts during the burst detection period. 

To estimate the relative contribution of transmission bursts to future transmission, divide the number of internal nodes during the follow-up period descended from bursts (A1) by the number of lineages active during the burst detection period involved in bursts (B1). Then, compare this ratio with the number of non-burst-descended inferred transmission events during the follow-up period (A2) divided by the number of non-burst-involved lineages during the burst detection period (B2). The relative contribution ratio is estimated as: 
(Contribution of lineages involved in bursts to future transmission)/(Contribution of lineages not involved in bursts to future transmission)=(A_1/B_1)/(A_2/B_2)

To describe populations affected by transmission bursts throughout the tree, rather than bursts identified within a single, defined burst detection period, bursts may be identified using a sliding window of a defined width. Phylogenetic tips are then classified as either (i) a member or descendant of a transmission burst or (ii) not a member or descendant of a transmission burst.
